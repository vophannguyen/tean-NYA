            <h3>How Does Last Chance Work?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Last Chance users are able to upload any personal reservation they can no longer commit to</p>
            <p> for others to claim.</p>
            <p>You can purchase tickets to concerts or parties, movie tickets, & dinner reservations. </p>
            <p>If interested, users have up to 20 minutes to commit to the reservation </p>
            <p>or it will be removed from your cart and added back to the main page for others to buy.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What can I upload?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>You can upload tickets to almost any event as long as it is unused and legitimate.</p>
            <p>Think dinner reservations, dance parties, small or large concerts, or movie screenings or premieres.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>How does pricing work?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>We never allow users to pay more than $10 for a ticket to any event.</p>
            <p>This is due to the entire nature of the website existing to allow users to make last minute plans,</p>
            <p>and allowing posters to feel relief that their reservations or events are not going entirely wasted.</p>
            <p>All Dinner reservations are free of charge to claim and posters cannot sell them for monetary value.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What qualifies as an event?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Any plans one may need a ticket or reservation for!</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>How do I retrieve my reservation or ticket?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>When listing an item, user is asked to upload a PDF file of their ticket.</p>
            <p>Once purchased, you will be able to view the PDF file through your profile page.</p>
